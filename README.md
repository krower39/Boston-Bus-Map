# Boston-Bus-Map
Tracking animation for a set of Boston bus stops
With help from following along with lectures, we made a map of Boston that updates where a bus is along hypothetical stops
HOW TO RUN
The map should open up once you click into the html file. Once you can see the map, click the button that says "Show Stops between MIT and Harvard" and then the image on the map starts moving through the array of coordinates that connects to bus stops in real life.
